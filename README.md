# REST-API
I basically used Data Structures only (not a real database), to design a REST API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a Book Entity.

The API performs the following function
- create a book
- delete a book
- edit a particular book
- retrieve a book with its details
- fetch all book with their details.

The Book Entity has the following attributes
- title
- authorName
- numberOfPages
- price
- ratingsÂ (1-5stars)
